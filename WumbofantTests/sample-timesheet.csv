ChoiceBoxes introduced another bug which caused an infinite recursion loop when an item was selected which was also fixed. #refactor Significant refactoring of the existing code was done to make it more reliable, hardened against further failure and because ChoiceBoxes work differently to ComboBoxes. #detail JavaFX has a bug which when combined with our ComboBox update code was preventing the ComboBoxes from updating correctly. This was fixed by instead switching to the older, more reliable ChoiceBox. Unfortunately due to the way the code was structured this caused an infinate loop on item selection so this also had to be worked around. The code was very unreadable and unreliable so it was refactored significantly in the process. #commits[b8fc647d5,35536da65,3c0b56060]",Matthew Knox,10.04.2015 16:40,2.00

4:Thirsty Goat,Kiqo,2: Organisation Station,Status reports,Add report generator,"#detail All the major issues have now been addressed. In order to print properties in a custom order I changed a single line in the yamlbeans library. I changed the set type from TreeMap to a LinkedHashMap. Whereas previously properties were printed in alphabetical order, the are now printed in the order in which they are listed in the Class file. In order to make this change, I had to do something which I am not entirely comfortable with, namely copy the whole damn library into our main/java source directory. First I tried extending the classes and then using @Overrides, but some of the classes that need to be overriden cannot be extended because they do not have default constructors. Another option would be monkey patching, but this looks like it would require adding even more complicated stuff to our project. Another option would be a git submodule, or a seperate public git repo with the library being imported as a maven dependency. Having a seperate git repo would make it easy to track how the customisations differ from the upstream library. Another option would be to make a pull request to the library maintainer. For now, I will leave things as they are as all this can easily be changed later. The next step is to tidy up the code/comments/javadoc and then commit. Once this is done I will begin focusing on other minor tweaks (like inserting blank lines to improve readability), these extra tweaks should be relatively easy to implement now that we have direct access to the source code of the library.",Leroy Hopson,24.04.2015 12:12,0.75
4:Thirsty Goat,Kiqo,2: Organisation Station,Status reports,Add report generator,"#detail Removed tags. Checked github forks of snakeyaml to see if problems I'm trying to address (see 1 & 2 below) have already been solved by someone else (nope). Read the code/messed around with stuff. Did some thinking. 2 can at least be easily solved with a hack (just set the fields you don't want printed to the default value) so I am not fussed about this one. 1 is going to take a lot of time to solve. I have some ideas, but it is just a matter of trying them out. Which will take a while. Once this problem has been solved however. It will be plain sailing. ",Leroy Hopson,24.04.2015 03:38,1.50
4:Thirsty Goat,Kiqo,2: Organisation Station,Status reports,Add report generator,"#detail Added yamlbeans again. Added no-arg constructors to every class except project (which already had a no-arg constructor) to make them JavaBean compliant. Got reports printing again. Got reports to print recursively for an object (without anchors). Also managed to filter default values out of reports (for example, excluding an Persons department when it's value is """"). There really only two steps left: 1. (the most important) Change the order in which properties are printed) 2. Be able to select *which* properties to print.

4:Thirsty Goat,Kiqo,2: Organisation Station,Status reports,Add report generator,"#detail Tried out snakeyaml. Started reading the docs, getting a feel for its capabilities. Seems have all the features of yamlbeans + more. Will keep hacking a way and see what kind of output I can get produced. I'm basically where I was at with yamlbeans this morning, which is promising. Will try and change the order with which properties are printed, also will try to actually print objects rather than just ids. snakeyaml community seems way more active, so that should be helpful. Okay, reading the acceptance criteria again, it seems that I should focus more on human readability and less on usefulness to other programs (e.g. for importing data, etc). So my plan then will be to make some helper functions which let you say for each class what properties of that class should be added to the report and in what order.",Leroy Hopson,17.04.2015 11:54,1.00
4:Thirsty Goat,Kiqo,2: Organisation Station,Status reports,Add report generator,"#detail Spent enumarable hours cargo culting yamlbeans to get output of the whole project. Encountered a few snags a long the way. Should be logging more frequently so that I can better report how I spent my time. Anyhow, major snag was that the yamlbeans (when serialising an entire graph) uses no arg constructors. Our project has none. Tried to Google the problem, not much out there on the internet. Found this http://sourceforge.net/p/yamlbeans/mailman/yamlbeans-talk/thread/7d6ffee60902021617n220f144bm104b73235889846@mail.gmail.com/ Then spent a long time cargo culting a solution until I finally read the source code of the library to better understand the error messages and what was actually going on. Here: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/yamlbeans/blob/9e07674b7d07ebef6f622ad23223768c44431914/src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/YamlConfig.java#L229 Okay, so I can use a @ConstructerParameter annotation. Awesome! At this point, I'm getting output for the whole project. The problem however is that I had to add an @ConstructorParameter to every model Class, this is unacceptable IMHO because it adds yet another piece of code that has be updated when you change the model. I also noticed that the output was printing the fields in alphabetical order so something like department would come before name. This is not ideal from a human readability perspective because some fields will be more important to a human (e.g. shortName) and so should be higher up on the output. There seems to be no easy way to change this order in yamlbeans. Lesson learned: Read the source code an especially the comments!!! Googling will only get you so far. Also I've learnt to log more frequently.",Leroy Hopson,17.04.2015 10:20,3.00
4:Thirsty Goat,Kiqo,2: Organisation Station,Status reports,Add report generator,"#detail Investigated options for writing yaml from java objects. Investigated the YAML beans library (looked at the javadoc, found out what it could do, etc.) Confident that this is a good option for generating reports. Next step will be to get it to actually produce some yaml. Then after that, customise the output. Hopefully there won't be any major snags along the way. The javadoc is pretty concise and the library ""seems"" to cover everything I think is needed, but we'll see.",Leroy Hopson,17.04.2015 01:21,1.00
